  <h3 class="headings">Background on Information Technology:</h3>
  <p class="description">
    Information Technology is a field focusing not only on technologies but also on various other aspects. In my college life in this field, I've learned a lot of things, especially the types of programming languages that can build a game, website, and even applications. This field is more than people think it is; it's not just about using a computer but delving into basic topics of programming to create new things by learning the concepts that Information Technology has to offer.
